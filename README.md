# cs50 Commerce
### Student Project w/ Django

I wrote this to in response to the following prompt: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/.

Work was started and completed in July, 2021. 

The code is fully functional and completely fulfills the specifications, to the best of my knowledge. 

Some of the code was pre-written by cs50 staff or comes with pre-packaged with Django.
